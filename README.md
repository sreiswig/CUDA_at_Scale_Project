The goal of this assignment is for you to develop a program that is performs either image or signal processing on a large amount of data (100s of small or 10s of large images and/or other signal) data. In the lab for this module, you will be able to execute your code and it will include enough sample data to prove that your code will execute on either a large number of small images, large images, or csv-based signals data.
